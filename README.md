# Avoy Internship Code Application

If you're reading you're probably trying to install this, so without further ado:

1.) install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2.) install the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)
3.) clone down this repo
4.) cd into the repo and run`npm install`, to make sure everything is up to date
5.) run `expo run` to be taken to the tool website
6.) from there you can either run on iOS sim (if you're on mac and have XCode installed), on Android(if you have android studio installed), or on the web(I dont recommend this, its bad)
