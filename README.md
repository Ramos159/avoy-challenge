# Avoy Internship Code Project

If you're reading you're probably trying to install this, so without further ado:

1. install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. install the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)
3. clone down this repo
4. cd into the repo and run`npm install`, to make sure everything is up to date
5. run `expo run` to be taken to the tool website

from there you can either run on iOS simulator (if you're on mac and have XCode installed), on Android simulator(if you have android studio installed), on the web(I dont recommend this, its bad), or if you have expo installed on your mobile device you can scan the QR and open the app there.

Enjoy!
